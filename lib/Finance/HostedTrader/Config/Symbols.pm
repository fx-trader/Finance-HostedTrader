=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::HostedTrader::Config::Symbols;
    my $obj = Finance::HostedTrader::Config::Symbols->new(
                    'natural'   => ['AUDUSD', 'USDJPY'],
                    'synthetic' => ['AUDJPY'],
                );

use Moose;

=attr C<natural>

Returns a list of natural symbols.
Natural symbols originate from the datasource, as opposed to synthetic symbols which are calculated based on natural symbols

Eg: AUDJPY can be synthetically calculated based on AUDUSD and USDJPY

=cut

has natural => (
    is     => 'ro',
    isa    => 'ArrayRef[Str]',
    required=>1,
);

=attr C<synthetic>

Returns a list of synthetic symbols.

See the description for natural symbols.

    # If it is a get call, call the Moose generated getter
    my $value = $self->$orig();
    return $value if (defined($value));

#register method modifier so that undef values can be converted to empty lists
around 'synthetic' => \&_around_symbols;

sub _build_synthetic {
    return [];
}

=method C<all>

Returns a list of all symbols, natural and synthetic.
