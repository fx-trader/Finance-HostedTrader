Update size.html in the Finance-HostedTrader-UI repo and deploy to joao@zonalivre.org:~/sites/zonalivre.org/web/size.html (Note: this location is outdated, need to find out where size.html should be deployed to)

# Make sure fx.yml has been deployed, and restart apache if it's important that mod_perl apps pickup the change to fx.yml imediatelly (Note: check if mod_perl is still used, it was initially, it's not as I write, but it might have come back as you read)
