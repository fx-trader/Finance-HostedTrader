The following query returns current index+data size which is helpful to calculate optimal index size

SELECT 
     table_schema as `Database`, 
     round((SUM(data_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) `Data  size in MB`,
     round((SUM(index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) `Index Size in MB` 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
GROUP BY table_schema;
